# auto-rdp
Automatically sets up stascorps RDPWrapper (v1.6.2).

I did not modify any of the RDPWrapper functionality or .ini files, the installed files are downloaded from the link below.

`https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases/download/v1.6.2/RDPWrap-v1.6.2.zip`

# How to use

```py
py -m installer.py
```
Note that the script needs to be executed with admin privileges in order to be able to unpack and move files inside your `C:\\Program Files` directory.


# I do not take responsibility for anything.

Creating a new local user and getting your the privileges right is still your responsibility.

Unfortunately, alot of things can cause bugs using the rdp-wrapper. I haven't run into one that I wasn't able to resolve with a bit of research though.
